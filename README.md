# Final-Project
Do you have items lying around the house that you don't use all the time ? 
wouldn't it be nice to earn some money by lending them out or perhaps you're after somthing useful but don't want to commit to buying it wouldn't be nice to save some money and borrow it from someone locally. 
Borrow it is the easy way to do exactly that!
